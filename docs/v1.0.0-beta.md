### Mod Features

#### 1. Sit Feature

Players can make an entity sit on a chair or any compatible block by **right-clicking** the block while looking at it. This allows entities to interact with furniture and similar blocks by sitting on them.

#### 2. Sleep Feature

Similar to the sit feature, entities can be made to sleep on a bed or any compatible block. To activate this, **right-click** the bed or block, and the selected entity will enter a sleeping state.

#### 3. Pathfinding for Individual Entities

To direct a selected entity along a specific path:

1.  Select the **Pathfinding Stick** item.
2.  Place the Pathfinding Stick block at the desired destination where you want the entity to go.
3.  Right-click on the entity you wish to move. The entity will then attempt to navigate to the location of the placed Pathfinding Stick.

#### 4. Collective Pathfinding for Multiple Entities

To make multiple entities follow a path to a single destination:

1.  Select the **Pathfinding Stick** item.
2.  Place the Pathfinding Stick block at the **single destination point** you want all selected entities to reach.
3.  **Right-click with the Pathfinding Stick on each entity** you want to include in the collective movement. All right-clicked entities will then attempt to navigate to the location of the placed Pathfinding Stick.

#### 5. Model and Texture Customization

Within the dedicated graphical user interface (opened by pressing `L`), you will find a button specifically for **resizing the entity**. This feature allows you to reduce the entity's size, making it appear like a child or a shorter character.
