## 🎮 Control Keys

### Default Hotkeys:
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **P** | Open keybinding customization window |
| **L** | Open the Human Control Panel (model & texture settings) |
| **X** | Make the selected entity speak (placeholder feature) |
| **Q**, **R**, **Z** | Reserved for future controls |

---

## ⚠️ Recommendation
To ensure full compatibility with the mod, we recommend **unbinding** the following default Minecraft keys:
- `P`, `X`, `L`, `Q`, `R`, `Z`  
These keys are used by Humans Mod for internal control features and may conflict with other mods or vanilla actions.

You can change or remove conflicting bindings from the Minecraft **Controls Settings**.

## 🧪 Known Limitations
- Not all models support all animations yet.  
- Texture switching might take a second to appear in some cases.  
- Speaking feature (`X`) is currently just a placeholder for future voice integration.
