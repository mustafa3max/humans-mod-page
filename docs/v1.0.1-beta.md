### üë• Group Control (Without Selected Entity)

If no entity is currently selected (i.e., the player hasn't right-clicked any entity), pressing the `C` key will open the **Group Control Interface**.

Steps to use:

1. Right-click any block to **clear the selected entity** (if one was previously selected).
2. Press `C` to open the Group Control window.
3. Choose one or more entities from the list (within a 64-block radius).
4. Assign a launch time for each entity.
5. Select one or more path markers (destination points).
6. Press the **Action** button to confirm.
7. Entities will move at their assigned times, each following the path and playing their animations independently.
